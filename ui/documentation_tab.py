üöÄ SETUP GUIDE
===============

INITIAL SETUP:
1. Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed
2. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Create .env file in project root (for AI features only)
4. Add your OpenAI API key: OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here

OPENAI API KEY (Optional - Only for AI Features):
‚Ä¢ Get key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
‚Ä¢ Required for Code Review and Document Merge features
‚Ä¢ Security Analysis works without API key (local only)
‚Ä¢ Estimated cost: $0.002-0.05 per analysis (very affordable!)

OPTIONAL SETTINGS:
‚Ä¢ OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini (default, recommended for cost)
‚Ä¢ OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o (premium quality, 15x more expensive)

VERIFICATION:
‚Ä¢ Use "Check Configuration" buttons in Code Review and Document Merge tabs
‚Ä¢ Security Analysis "Check Configuration" verifies local analyzer
‚Ä¢ Should show ‚úÖ Ready messages when properly configured


üîß TROUBLESHOOTING
==================

COMMON ISSUES:

"No OpenAI API key found" (Code Review/Document Merge)
‚Ä¢ Create .env file in project root
‚Ä¢ Add: OPENAI_API_KEY=your-actual-key
‚Ä¢ Restart Wolfkit

"Security analyzer configuration error"
‚Ä¢ Restart Wolfkit to reload pattern engine
‚Ä¢ Check Python version (3.8+ required)
‚Ä¢ Verify file permissions in project directory

"Analysis failed" / "Merge failed"
‚Ä¢ Check internet connection (for AI features)
‚Ä¢ Verify API key is valid
‚Ä¢ Try smaller batch of files
‚Ä¢ Check OpenAI API usage limits

"No project directory set"
‚Ä¢ Click "Set Project Directory" in File Testing tab
‚Ä¢ Choose a valid folder with your project files

"No files selected"
‚Ä¢ Use file selection buttons before running operations
‚Ä¢ Ensure files exist and are accessible

Virtual Environment Issues
‚Ä¢ Wolfkit auto-detects venv in project directory
‚Ä¢ Manually activate venv if needed: venv/Scripts/activate
‚Ä¢ Check Python path in console output

File Permission Errors
‚Ä¢ Ensure Wolfkit has read/write access to project folder
‚Ä¢ Run as administrator if needed (Windows)
‚Ä¢ Check file locks (close editors/IDEs)

Large Document Processing
‚Ä¢ Very large PDFs may timeout
‚Ä¢ Break into smaller batches
‚Ä¢ Check available system memory

Security Analysis Issues
‚Ä¢ Large codebases may take several minutes
‚Ä¢ Use Quick Scan mode for faster results
‚Ä¢ Check file encoding if analysis fails on specific files

API Rate Limits
‚Ä¢ OpenAI has usage limits per minute/day
‚Ä¢ Wait a moment and retry
‚Ä¢ Consider upgrading API plan for heavy usage
